## Introduction

## Getting started

### Connection settings

The following settings are required to connect to the API.

| Setting     | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |

| AADTenantID      | The Azure Tenant ID of your Azure environment                  |
| AADAppID               |     The App ID of the "App registration" in your Azure AD enviroment. The "App registration" in Azure is the identity with which this HelloID connector will log in your Azure environment to perform all actions |

| AADAppSecret               |     The "Client secret" generated by the "App registration" in your Azure AD enviroment, that serves as a sort of password.
